         <h2 >The Underdogs, Our Success Story! </h2> <hr/>
           <p> We love an underdog. Everybody embraces the lovable team that’s not expected 
           to win, especially when people can’t find a team to root for.</p>

<p>There are two types of underdogs. The first is the lifelong underdog, 
the classic — someone or some team that has never had the ability and has no 
history of winning. Maybe even the classic lovable loser. </p>

<p>Then there’s the other kind: a power who’s had injuries or some outside force 
that has turned a magical season into something else. The Eagles are that type of 
underdog.</p>

<p>The Eagles were the No. 1 seed in the NFC, but when Carson Wentz went down with a 
torn ACL late in the season, we turned to Nick Foles to guide the offense. The Eagles 
are the first home underdog in the Divisional Round since 1970. </p>
<p>
Underdog status also unites a fan base with its players. Eagles players wore 
dog masks, and so did the fans. It’s a rallying cry that the fan base
 can understand, because we know the feeling of being an underdog at some point in our 
 lifetime. </p>
<p>
Winning in the NFL is sweet. It’s something that makes every single person
in the city happy. Winning a Super Bowl is a feeling that we have never experienced in Philly. 
So when you’re the underdog and you win, you feel an extra sense 
of pride & joy and an extra sense of accomplishment. That’s why we love underdogs and I love 
underdogs! </p>
